# Chop Chop! 

## Overview
“We already have food at home!” Everyone’s heard it but how many people can actually whip up a meal from the array of ingredients at home? Introducing Chop Chop! Our app will allow you to choose ingredients in your pantry or fridge and give you recipes to make. 

With Chop Chop you can find new recipes with even the most unrelated ingredients. Our app will also allow you to choose recipes from our database and display the ingredients.

## Projected Features
1. Recipes are suggested to the user if they have some or all ingredients necessary to make the dish.
2. Users can choose recipes to see the ingredients necessary.
3. A grocery list of needed ingredients can be generated if the user wants to make a recipe. While shopping, user can check off what they bought and it will be stored/updated in user’s ingredients list.
4. Users can see recipes made in the past, save recipes they want to make in the future, or share with a friend.
